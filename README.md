# ORCiD CV Generator

This very simple and not particularly well written Python script pulls details about your publications and education from ORCiD, then uses Crossref to add other details. 

The script is not drastically different to the output of the printable ORCiD, so unless you really need something in this script, just use that. Itâ€™s better, I promise.
